  "SentryGuard requires active Sentry Mode": "Yes, Sentry Mode must be active on your Tesla vehicle for SentryGuard to detect and send alerts. The service monitors when Sentry Mode is triggered, but it cannot function if Sentry Mode is disabled in your vehicle settings.",
  "Why we chose Telegram": "Telegram was chosen because it's a fast, reliable, and secure messaging platform that works globally. It provides instant notifications without requiring users to install additional apps, and it has excellent battery efficiency. Unlike SMS or other messaging services, Telegram is free, encrypted, and works reliably across all countries.",
  "Why no mobile app": "SentryGuard is developed by a small community team with limited resources and no budget. Creating and maintaining a mobile app would require significant additional development time, app store submissions, and ongoing maintenance across iOS and Android platforms.

Finally, check that you haven't blocked the Telegram bot.",
  "SentryGuard battery impact": "No, SentryGuard has no impact on your vehicle's battery or range. The service uses Tesla's telemetry system, which is designed to be extremely efficient. Unlike third-party apps that might poll your vehicle constantly, SentryGuard only receives data when events occur, using minimal bandwidth and no additional battery power from your vehicle.",

  "Tesla Premium Connectivity requirement": "No, you do not need Tesla Premium Connectivity to use SentryGuard.

  "Why doesn't Sentry Mode trigger when I test it myself?": "Why doesn't Sentry Mode trigger when I test it myself?",
  "Sentry Mode testing explanation": "When testing Sentry Mode yourself with your phone nearby, Tesla detects your digital key and doesn't trigger Sentry Mode because it recognizes an authorized user. Sentry Mode only activates when the vehicle senses potential unauthorized activity. To properly test, either use someone else's phone to trigger motion/camera detection, or test from further away without your phone present.",
  "Why is SentryGuard faster than Tesla notifications?": "Why is SentryGuard faster than Tesla notifications?",
  "SentryGuard speed advantage explanation": "SentryGuard provides instant notifications as soon as Tesla detects an event and begins recording, giving you immediate awareness of potential security incidents. In contrast, Tesla's own app only shows recorded video after the recording is complete, and even Tesla's direct notifications arrive several seconds later. This speed advantage can be crucial for responding quickly to security threats.",
