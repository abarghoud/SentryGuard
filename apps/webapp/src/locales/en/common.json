It uses Tesla's official API and telemetry to provide efficient monitoring without draining your battery.",
  "SentryGuard requires active Sentry Mode": "Yes, Sentry Mode must be active on your Tesla vehicle for SentryGuard to detect and send alerts. The service monitors when Sentry Mode is triggered, but it cannot function if Sentry Mode is disabled in your vehicle settings.",
  "Why we chose Telegram": "Telegram was chosen because it's a fast, reliable, and secure messaging platform that works globally. It provides instant notifications without requiring users to install additional apps, and it has excellent battery efficiency. Unlike SMS or other messaging services, Telegram is free, encrypted, and works reliably across all countries.",
  "Why no mobile app": "SentryGuard is developed by a small community team with limited resources and no budget. Creating and maintaining a mobile app would require significant additional development time, app store submissions, and ongoing maintenance across iOS and Android platforms. Since Telegram already provides excellent mobile notifications, we focused our limited resources on the core functionality. The web interface is responsive and works well on mobile devices.",

Finally, check that you haven't blocked the Telegram bot.",
  "SentryGuard battery impact": "No, SentryGuard has no impact on your vehicle's battery or range. The service uses Tesla's telemetry system, which is designed to be extremely efficient. Unlike third-party apps that might poll your vehicle constantly, SentryGuard only receives data when events occur, using minimal bandwidth and no additional battery power from your vehicle.",

  "Does SentryGuard provide video footage?": "Does SentryGuard provide video footage?",
  "SentryGuard video access explanation": "SentryGuard does not have access to video footage from your vehicle's cameras.

However, Premium Connectivity may be required for some advanced Tesla features, but SentryGuard itself operates with basic vehicle connectivity.",
  "Why doesn't Sentry Mode trigger when I test it myself?": "Why doesn't Sentry Mode trigger when I test it myself?",
  "Sentry Mode testing explanation": "When testing Sentry Mode yourself with your phone nearby, Tesla detects your digital key and doesn't trigger Sentry Mode because it recognizes an authorized user. Sentry Mode only activates when the vehicle senses potential unauthorized activity. To properly test, either use someone else's phone to trigger motion/camera detection, or test from further away without your phone present.",
  "Why is SentryGuard faster than Tesla notifications?": "Why is SentryGuard faster than Tesla notifications?",
  "SentryGuard speed advantage explanation": "SentryGuard provides instant notifications as soon as Tesla detects an event and begins recording, giving you immediate awareness of potential security incidents. In contrast, Tesla's own app only shows recorded video after the recording is complete, and even Tesla's direct notifications arrive several seconds later. This speed advantage can be crucial for responding quickly to security threats.",

  "What is the purpose of pairing a virtual key with SentryGuard?": "What is the purpose of pairing a virtual key with SentryGuard?",
  "Virtual key purpose explanation": "The virtual key paired with your vehicle is SentryGuard's secure identifier. It allows your Tesla to verify that telemetry configuration messages genuinely come from SentryGuard. This provides an additional security layer beyond the authentication token generated when you first connect with Tesla. Your vehicle verifies both that you (the owner) have granted permissions to SentryGuard and that it's genuinely SentryGuard using those permissions, not a compromised or stolen access.",
  "Does SentryGuard work without internet connection?": "Does SentryGuard work without internet connection?",
  "Internet connection requirement explanation": "No, internet access is required for SentryGuard to function. When a Sentry Mode event occurs, your Tesla needs internet connectivity (via WiFi or cellular) to send the event data to our servers, which then forward the alert to you via Telegram. If your vehicle is in a location without internet access (such as an underground parking garage or a country where Tesla connectivity isn't available), alerts cannot be sent until the vehicle reconnects to the internet.",
  "Why does the app crash when I use browser translation?": "Why does the app crash when I use browser translation?",
  "Browser translation issue explanation": "Using your browser's automatic translation feature (such as Chrome's \"Translate this page\" or similar features in other browsers) can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. SentryGuard already supports multiple languages natively. Instead of using browser translation, please use the language selector in the application's navigation bar to switch between English and French. This ensures a stable experience without any technical issues.",
